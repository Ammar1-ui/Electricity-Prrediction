# Electricity-Prrediction
This was my major project of 8th sem where with the help of LSTM model , randomforest model and support vector regression model , prediction of Electricity would be done . 
Not only the basics of that model I also implement advanced version of this models which is after LSTM model i implemented deep LSTM model into that which provide extra hidden layers for prediction.
with RandomForest Model I implemented Fuzzy system in which I fuzzyfy the input data for prediction.
And last with Support Vector regression model I implemented Neural Neural Networks for better accuracy.
